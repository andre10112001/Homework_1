    "## Homework Assigment One\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework activities aim not only at testing your ability to put into practice the concepts you have learned during the Lectures and Labs, but also your ability to explore the Python documentation as a resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, it is an opportunity for you to challenge yourself and practice. If you are having difficulties with the assignment reach out for support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Homework Assigment One is divided into **three parts**:\n",
    "1. Explore the core building blocks of programming, focusing in variables, data structures, and their manipulation;\n",
    "2. Explore data loading and analysis using the core elements of Python, without fancy third-party libraries;\n",
    "3. Explore functional programming by defining different functions and operating with the map() and filter().\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be graded according to the following guidelines:\n",
    "1. **Execution** (does your program do what is asked from the exercise?);\n",
    "2. **Objectivity** (are you using the adequate libraries?);\n",
    "3. **Readibility** of your code (that includes comments, naming of variables, supporting text, etc ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is to be done in groups of two, groups that are caught cheating will obtain a score of 0 points. \\\n",
    "\n",
    "Oral Examination will be conducted to a subset of groups picked randomly and or that have been flagged during the grading\n",
    "\n",
    "The Homeworking Assignment One is worth **20%** of your final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission package should correspond to a .zip archive (**.rar files are not accepted**) with the following files:\n",
    "1. Jupyter Notebook with the output of all the cells;\n",
    "2. PDF/HTML of your Jupyter Notebook (on Jupyter go to File -> Download As -> PDF);\n",
    "3. All text or .csv files exported as part of the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes: \n",
    "- **You are ONLY allowed to use any library from the Python STL (see here https://docs.python.org/3/library/).**\n",
    "- **Comment your code properly, which includes naming your variables in a meaningful manner. Badly documented code will be penalized.**</b>\n",
    "- **Submissions in non .zip format will be penalized with 2 points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission is done through the respective Moodle activity.\\\n",
    "Deadline is **20223-09-28**, a Thursday, at 23:59.\\\n",
    "A penality of 1 point per day late will be applied to late deliveries."

    "**18**: The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle loosely based on the American television game show \"Let's Make a Deal\" and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The puzzle can be stated as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? <br>\n",
    "+info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem\n",
    "\n",
    "While intuitively your guess might be that the chances of winning the car is 1/3 independently of the choice to switch doors or not. Howewver, the odds of winning if you switch doors are 2/3 and greater than if you decide not to switch. While there are theoretical solutions to this problem that allow us to estimate the correct odds of winning in each scenario -- switching or not doors -- an alternative way to proof such outcome is through computer simulations. That is the goal of this exercise, to write the necessary components to simulate the Monty Hall problem and validate the theoretical results through simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, start by implementing a function that simulates one instance of the Monty Hall problem. \n",
    "In that sense, write a function called MontyHall that accepts **one argument**:\n",
    "- A boolean (True/False, or 1/0) that specifies if the player switches doors or not (after the host has opened his door, which contains a goat).\n",
    "The function should return True if the player wins the car or False if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, for the function to reproduce the contest it needs to consider and perform some actions, such as:\n",
    "- Set up the game, that is, create the necessary variables to store the information about three doors and what they have behind, as well as an indicator to track the choice of the player.\n",
    "- Given the initial choice of the player, simulate the opening of one of the two remaining doors that contains a goat.\n",
    "- Given the last two doors left, simulate if the player wants to switch or not his/her choice given their strategy (defined by the input boolean argument of the function).\n",
    "- Output the result, if the contestant correctly guesses which door hides the car or if not.\n",

    "The function MontyHall should simulate one instance of the contest given the choice of the player (to switch or not).\n",
